Currency: Loveca stones
Earning:
-Checking in daily (5 loveca)
-Adding a song to the queue (10 loveca)

Cards will be sorted in these categories:
-Number: card number in database
-Rarity: UR, SSR, SR, R, N, and Limited UR(autographed URs, not sure what about series that aren't Love Live)
-Name: unique to each card
-Character: yup
-Set: what set it belongs to
-Source: what series it comes from
store images on imgur then store link to image in database

Every series will contain:
20 Normal cards
One Initial set (characters in their normal outfits)
Any set after that has to have a theme for cards to be grouped in a set
After maybe 10 sets restrictions of rarities in sets will relax
-Just avoid solely adding URs like Love Live is doing right now.

A set will contain:
5 SRs
2 SSRs
2 URs
SSRs are optional but there has to be more SRs than URs

Limited URs can be released without set.

Gacha rates:
0.05% Limited UR
0.95% UR
4% SSR
15% SR
30% R
50% N

-Guaranteed SR or higher rates:
1% Limited UR
2% UR
6% SSR
91% SR

Gacha pull prices:
-5 loveca for single pull
-50 for 10+1 pull, one card SR or higher guaranteed
-How to implement this:
--Random number for each pull then choose which pool of cards to pick from

Features outside of Gacha:
-Trading (bot sends dm to user with trade offer from another user)
-Display box (showing off favorite cards obtained)
-Selling duplicates after every roll
    -though should i count duplicates to begin with?

Extra notes:
-Would need two different databases, one to hold info about users, the other to hold card info

Database for individual users
Id, number of song queues, number of messages, loveca count
